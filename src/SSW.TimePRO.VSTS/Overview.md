## Make Timesheets Easy  
SSW TimePRO allows developers to easily enter their timesheets, by linking to checkins and work items directly. This flows through to the TimePRO system allowing for tracking, reporting and invoicing.

With TimePRO you can:  

 * Enter timesheets in less than 30 seconds
 * As a developer you don't have to leave visualstudio.com
 * Track costs against PBIs and other work items
